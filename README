## Implementation

```
---------------- PLANNING ------------------

Pieces
* X = False
* O = True
* Blank = None

Board
* Just 2D array of pieces

Minimax
* takes in a board, a move, and which player to move
* if the move wins the game, return a 1
* if not, it preforms the algorithm for all possible moves the other player can make recursively
